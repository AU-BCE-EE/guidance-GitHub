# Best practice for working with Git and GitHub
This is a collection of best practice tips.
We should all aim to follow these or else modify them so they are practical.

## File and directory names
* Lowercase letters in files and directories are generally preferred, but not required.
* Spaces should be avoided! They make command-line work difficult. 
* Instead of spaces, use underscores `_` or hyphens `-`, but try to be consistent within a repo.
* Use only a single dot `.` in a file names--between the name and the extension. Good: `mass_means.csv`, bad: `mass.means.csv`.
