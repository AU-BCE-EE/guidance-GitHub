# Using git at the command line
Git software is actually pretty easy to use on the command line, with a couple exceptions, including merge conflicts.
Why might you do it instead of using GitHub Desktop?
It can be faster (type a few lines instead of a lot of mouse clicks and typing) and eliminates the need to install more software.
Command-line operations can be really powerful and quick on all operating systems, so git can be a good way to get started. 
Plus, you can impress coworkers by regularly doing work at the command line!

# A demo
We use git like this.
First, open up a command-line interface and browse to your repo directory.
On Windows, Power Shell is the interface of choice.
Here I found it with windows key + typing power she.
